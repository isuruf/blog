R 4.0 Migration Retrospective
=============================

While the R 4.0 migration has been functionally complete for quite a while, the recent migration of ``r-java`` and
its dependents gives a good opportunity to write a retrospective on the technical issues with large-scale migrations
in ``conda-forge`` and how we solved them.

The R 4.0 migration rebuilt every package in ``conda-forge`` that had ``r-base`` as a requirement, including more
than 2200 feedstocks. A migration of this size in ``conda-forge`` faces several hurdles. First, since every feedstock
is a separate GitHub repository, one needs to merge more 2200 pull requests (PRs). Second, ``conda-forge``'s packages
on ``anaconda.org`` are behind a CDN (content delivery network). This service reduces web hosting costs for Anaconda Inc.
but introduces an approximately 30 minute delay from when a package is uploaded to ``anaconda.org`` and when it will
appear as available using ``conda`` from the command line. Thus, even if the dependencies of a package have been built,
we have to wait until they appear on the CDN before we can successfully issue the next PR and have it build correctly.
Finally, the existing bot and ``conda`` infrastructure limited the throughput of the migrations, due in part to the speed
of the ``conda`` solver.

Given the size of the R 4.0 migration, we took this opportunity to try out a bunch of new technology to speed up large-scale
migrations. The main enhancements were using GitHub Actions to automerge PRs, using ``mamba`` to quickly check for solvability
of package environments, and enabling long-running migration jobs for the autotick bot. All told, the bulk of the feedstocks
for R 4.0 were rebuilt in less than a week, with many PRs being merged in 30 minutes or less from when they were issued. These
enhancements to the autotick bot and ``conda-forge`` infrastructure can be used to enhance future migrations (e.g., Python 3.9)
and reduce maintenance burdens for feedstocks.


Automerging conda-forge PRs
---------------------------

In a typical migration on ``conda-forge``, we issue a PR to a feedstock and then ask the feedstock maintainers to
make sure it passes and merge it. In the case of the R 4.0 migration, the maintainers of R packages on ``conda-forge``
use a maintenance team (i.e., ``@conda-forge/r``) on the vast majority of feedstocks. This team is small and so merging
over 2000 PRs by hand is a big undertaking. Thus, with their permission, we added the ``conda-forge`` automerge
functionality to all R feedstocks that they maintain. The automerge bot, which relies on GitHub Actions, is able to
automatically merge any PR from the autotick bot that passes the recipe linter, the continuous integration services,
and has the special ``[bot automerge]`` slug in the PR title. This feature removed the bottleneck of waiting for
maintainers to merge PRs and reduced the maintenance burden on the R maintenance team.


Checking Solvability with mamba
-------------------------------

While being able to automatically merge PRs removed much of the work of performing the R 4.0 migration,
it relied on the PR building correctly the first time it was issued. Due to the CDN delays and the build times
of a package's dependencies, the dependencies of a package may not be immediately available after all of their
migration PRs are merged. If the bot issued the packages migration PR before the dependents are available, the
PR would fail with an unsolvable environment and have to be restarted manually. This failure would negate any of the
benefits of using automerge in the first place.

To control for this edge case, we employed the ``mamba`` package to check for the solvability of a PR's environments
before the PR was issued. ``mamba`` is a fast alternative to ``conda`` that produces solutions for environments orders
of magnitude more quickly. Since, we have to perform our checks of PR environments many times, an extremely fast solver
was essential for making the code efficient enough to run as part of the autotick bot. We ended up using mamba to try to
install the dependencies for every variant produced by the feedstock to be migrated. With this check in place, the
autotick bot was able to issue migration PRs that passed on the first try and were thus automatically merged, many within
30 minutes or less.


Improving the Autotick Bot's Efficiency
---------------------------------------

Finally, we made several upgrades to the autotick bot infrastructure to increase the uptime of the bot and its
efficiency. First, we moved from an hourly cron job to a set of chained CI jobs. This change eliminated downtime
between the runs of the bot. Second, we started to refactor the autotick bot from one monolithic piece of code
into a distributed set of microservices which perform various independent tasks in parallel. These independent
tasks, used for things like checking the statuses of previously issued PRs, are run separately allowing the bot
to spend more time issuing PRs. Finally, we optimized the internal prioritization of the PRs to make sure the
bot was spending more time on larger migrations where there is more work to do. More work on the autotick bot
infrastructure, including work done by Vinicius Cerutti as part of the Google Summer of Code program, will further
streamline the bot's operation.

Despite some initial hiccups with the bot infrastructure, the migration ran quite smoothly for an endeavor of
its size. The vast majority of migration PRs were completed within a week from when we started, which is a first
for a migration of this size on ``conda-forge``. The largest issue was solved recently, with the fixing of the
``openjdk`` recipe and the removal of ``aarch64`` and ``ppc64le`` builds from ``r-java``, enabling the last
large piece of the R ecosystem to be updated.

Looking forward, the improvements we made for the R 4.0 migration seem broadly applicable to other migration tasks,
including the yearly python minor version bump. These kinds of large-scale migrations are particularly suitable,
since they usually involve few changes to the feedstock itself and usually fail on CI when a broken package
would be produced. Faster migrations will help to provide the latest features to downstream users and
keep transition times to a minimum, helping to foster greater stability of the ecosystem and the seamless experience
users have come to expect from ``conda-forge``.
